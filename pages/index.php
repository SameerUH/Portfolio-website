    <div id="aboutme">
        <p><u>About Me:</u><br>
        I'm Sameer Ul Haq, a second-year Cyber Security student at Northumbria University, passionate about the intersection of technology, security, and meaningful impact. I hold a CCNA certification and actively develop my skills through platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box, where I explore real-world attack scenarios and defensive strategies.<br>
        Alongside my security focus, I enjoy programming in Python, C, and JavaScript, building everything from simple games to full-stack applications. I aim to combine this technical foundation with hands-on experience to grow into a well-rounded cyber security professional.<br><br>
        <u>Interests:</u><br>
        I'm most excited when working on projects that challenge me creatively and technically. I've developed applications like Pong, GratiThink (a web/mobile app that promotes student wellbeing), and interactive portfolio websites using modern tools like React and Three.js. I also enjoy problem-solving, collaborative teamwork, and continuously learning how different programming languages can be applied to help people in practical ways.<br><br>

        <u>Motiviations:</u><br>
        At the heart of my journey is a belief that technology should be used to protect and empower. Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in safeguarding people, data, and infrastructure â€” and I'm inspired by how it can also be used to build digital tools that support mental health, safety, and trust in an increasingly connected world.

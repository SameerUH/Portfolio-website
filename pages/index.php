        <div class="card-content">
            <p><span class="underline bold text-large">About Me:</span><br>
                I'm Sameer Ul Haq, a second-year Cyber Security student at Northumbria University with a passion for tech, security, and making a meaningful impact. I'm CCNA certified and regularly develop my skills through TryHackMe and Hack The Box.<br><br>I enjoy programming in Python, C, and JavaScript — building everything from small games to full-stack apps — and aim to grow into a well-rounded cybersecurity professional.<br><br>

                <span class="underline bold text-large">Interests:</span><br>
                I'm most excited when working on projects that challenge me creatively and technically. I've developed applications like Pong, GratiThink (a web/mobile app that promotes student wellbeing), and interactive portfolio websites using modern tools like React and Three.js. I also enjoy problem-solving, collaborative teamwork, and continuously learning how different programming languages can be applied to help people in practical ways.<br><br>

                <span class="underline bold text-large">Motivations:</span><br>
                I believe technology should protect and empower. Cybersecurity is evolving and is key to safeguarding people and data and I'm inspired by how tech can protect people from various attackers.

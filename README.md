<h1>Turning code into something personal — SameerUH 💻</h1>

<strong>Live: https://sameeruh.dev</strong>

A personal portfolio built as my biggest multi-month project so far — planned in June and finished & published in December. This site was an exercise in making something that represents me, not just something that works.

Highlights
- First dive into 3D web development with Three.js: an animated name that doubles as a home button and a network-switch model to showcase projects.
- Creative visuals beyond the usual portfolio: looping backgrounds, animated frames on the homepage, and subtle navbar animations for a more interactive feel.
- Built without a front-end framework (HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, PHP) — routing, structure, and interactivity handled manually for full control.

I’m proud of how it turned out and how much I learned along the way — excited to keep iterating and building bigger things. 😄

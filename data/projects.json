      "fullDescription": "This was my first major programming project during Year 10 as a practice for my NEA in year 11. I really wanted to do something with PyGame as I found it would be fun to make a 2D game which would keep me interested when programming it at home and learning PyGame at the same time.\n\nDuring the learning process I started with the basics of PyGame by changing the colour of the background and making some simple shapes which changes colour, then after watching some TechWithTim videos I learnt how to create characters using classes and implement gravity.\n\nWhen starting with the project I wanted to focus more on user experience than graphics so I started with both the player and enemy classes and implemented a jump function, after I learnt how to add hitboxes to shapes so I could add floors for the character to sit on, also created by classes which made it easy to make multiple of them for the game.\n\nAfter, I implemented scoring and lives by adding them as variables to the constructors of the player and enemy classes and made it so the user gains a point if they collide with the star and lose a life if the enemy collides with them. Finally after adding a start screen and an end screen which trigger if the user has no more lives the project was finished.\n\nOverall I was pretty happy with how the project went, especially since it was my first “big” project that I had the control and creativity of to design and implement the programming of and if I were to go back and add/fix some elements I would do the following.\n\nMusic: I wanted to add some basic music/sound effects to make the game more engaging but after trying with pygame.mixer I couldn’t figure it out and get the music to play. This was more of a side feature though so I only spent a couple of hours trying to figure it out.\n\nJump function: The function is very laggy and weird with both the user and enemy, the enemy jumps the same time as the player and they jump and fall far too quickly which even messes with the hitboxes sometimes. Ultimately messing with the experience of the game and making it more difficult/confusing to play, with the way the jump function works I could try and decrease the jumps height or make another variable called gravity and set it to a very small value making the characters fall slower.\n\nFloors: There were far too many floors to keep track of with hitboxes and I ended up having around 100 lines of code for checking when the player or enemy would collide with them, this was obviously inefficient at the time and looking back I could have very easily put all the floors in a list and then loop through that list to look for collisions, I have added this another project I did and it worked out much nicer and simpler than the current solution in this project.\n\nAttacks: I tried to add a shooting feature to the characters where they would throw shooting stars/daggers at each other with another button as I thought it would be a cool feature for users to enjoy but after many trials and errors I decided to scrap the idea mainly because the enemy was acting too random for them to accurate with their weapon and because it would most likely make the game too easy for the player if they just keep killing the enemy.",
